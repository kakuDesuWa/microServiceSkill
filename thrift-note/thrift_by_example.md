# Thrift by Example

## Generating code with Thrift

```
thrift -f --gen py filename.thrift
```

The above command will generate a directory gen-py will contain all the code generated by Thrift in python. The option ```-r``` is to specify that t want to generate recursively code for potential includes on our .thrift file. After generating code to do the hard work for you, as you will see below.

## A Simple Example to warm-up

On this example I will demonstrate the creation of a simple multiplication service.

- Lets create first the .thrift definition of our service. The .thrift file I am going to use is the same you saw in the [How to Writing a .thrift file](./how_to_write_thritf.md) and is as shown below:

```
namespace py tutorial
namespace java tutorial

typedef i32 int // We can use typedef to get pretty names for the types we are using
service MultiplicationService {
    int multiply(1: int n1, 2: int n2),
}
```

- then run

```
thrift --gen py namefile.thrift
thrift --gen py:tornado namefile.thrift
```
